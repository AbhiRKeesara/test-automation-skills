# Assertion Utilities

Build centralized assertion utilities (AssertUtils and ExpectUtils) for consistent, reusable test validation.

## What You'll Learn

- How to create value-based (AssertUtils) and DOM-based (ExpectUtils) assertion classes
- Patterns for standardized error messages and soft assertions
- Techniques for extending assertions with custom validation logic
- How to unify assertion styles across a large test suite

## Quick Start

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the full guide. Start with the **Architecture Overview** to understand the split between AssertUtils and ExpectUtils.
